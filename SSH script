Generate RSA key pair

ssh to localhost

--what I did after this--
cd Downloads
chmod 600 myKey.pem
ssh -i myKey.pem instance name@public ip
encountered error Warning: Identity file /Downloads/myKey.pem not accessible: No such file or directory.

Turns out myKey.pem file was missing from .ssh directory, (hidden file, ctrl+h to view) ; pasted it in folder and everything worked!
